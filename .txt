Flasite is a Blogging Application which allows users to interact with each other by creating posts which other users can view. 
So Flasite is a webapp made using Flask micro framework written in python. So the Front end was made using HTML and CSS,
whereas the  backend was done using Python Flask. The Database used for the project was initially SQLite3 which was later
updated to be a postgress Database. I have also deployed the final app on Heroku.
